Question: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Answer: The Gaming Room client is a gaming company seeking to transition its game, Draw It or Lose It, from an Android-only application to a web-based platform that supports multiple devices. The client required a solution that ensures multi-platform compatibility, supports multiple teams and players in a game, enforces unique identifiers and names for games, teams, and players, and allows for efficient management of entities. Additionally, the solution needed to be scalable, secure, and capable of maintaining real-time state consistency.

Question: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Answer: I feel I did particularly well in clearly identifying the client’s needs and translating them into actionable software requirements. I also provided detailed explanations of the system architecture and how the Singleton and Entity patterns would ensure scalability and maintainability. The documentation was structured to address both technical and business needs effectively.

Question: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Answer: Working through the design document was incredibly helpful because it gave me a clear roadmap before jumping into development. It forced me to think through potential challenges, such as maintaining consistency across multiple devices or ensuring scalability. Having the design laid out also reduced ambiguity during coding and kept the project aligned with the client’s goals.

Question: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Answer: If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the evaluation of different operating platforms. While I provided a solid recommendation for Linux, I could have included more technical details or performance comparisons to strengthen the justification. This would make the recommendation more robust and better address potential client concerns.

Question: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Answer: I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing their requirements for scalability, multi-platform support, and real-time interactions. I implemented these through features like the Singleton pattern for centralized game management, unique identifiers for all entities, and a modular architecture to ensure scalability. It’s critical to consider user needs because the software ultimately has to meet their expectations and provide a seamless experience.

Question: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Answer: I approached the design by using OOP principles, domain modeling, and architectural patterns like Singleton and composition. This ensured the design was scalable and maintainable. In the future, I would use more prototyping and gather user feedback earlier in the process to validate my ideas. Additionally, I’d incorporate agile methodologies to iteratively refine the design and use tools like UML diagrams to better visualize the architecture.
